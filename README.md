This repository contains a restaurant ordering app developed in JavaScript. This project was the culmination of the advanced JavaScript module at Scrimba. I am immensely proud of the work I have accomplished and the skills I have acquired throughout this project.

Project Overview
The restaurant ordering app was created to meet specific expectations, including adhering to design specifications while also adding my own personal touch. It incorporates essential functionalities such as adding and removing items from the order, a pop-up form modal for customer information input, and a thank you modal displayed upon order completion.

Accomplishments
Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, including debugging and troubleshooting. One particularly frustrating bug took days to resolve, primarily due to overthinking the issue. Despite attempting to solve it independently and even seeking assistance from ChatGPT, the solution remained elusive. However, after revisiting the problem with a fresh perspective, I was able to overcome it. (I also cheered loudly; I think the neighbors heard me)

Additionally, I successfully implemented stretch goals, such as incorporating discounts into the app.

Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Scrimba for providing a platform for learning and development. I am thankful for the support and guidance of my friend, @Jurkyy, whose expertise helped me navigate the final hurdles in completing this project.

Conclusion
In conclusion, I am thrilled with the outcome of this project. The restaurant ordering app is a testament to my dedication to learning and problem-solving skills. I look forward to applying these newfound skills to future projects and endeavors.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
